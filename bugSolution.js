//This is a solution for the Tailwind CSS bug, in which the plugin is not working properly in some cases.
//Solution:
//Add the following CSS to your project:
.bg-gradient-to-r {
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, #ff0000, #0000ff);
}
//This will fix the bug and the gradient will be applied correctly.
//Example:
<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500"></div>
```
